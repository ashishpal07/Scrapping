      "review I pre ordered the item on sept 21 and received ok 2 Oct . It was in iOS 13 . It is buttery smooth and nice and there was an update of ios13.1.2 available. But after updating I stuck in Apple logo. I could not create a return in Amazon as it's asked me to contact Apple. I wonder why is that.\n",

      "review I will rate one start for this product. My experience of using this phone for one week is sub-par, multiple times in this one week this phone hanged. Many time even home screen was hanged( i have installed only five additional apps quora, amazon, facebook, whatsapp and google maps). Please refrain from purchasing this phone. It is waste of money.\n",
      "review In love with it\n",
      "review I was using iPhone XS Max, but now after having iPhone 11 Pro Max - I can say it is fabulous and outstanding. Perfect as always, performance is too good.Night mode is better than any available camera, Pixel 4 XL, Mate 30 Pro and Note 10+.This device is unbeatable (until next iPhone).\n",
      "review Ohh God, I sold my one kidney to buy this phone thinking that it will be wonderful experience but after getting it in my hand i literally felt it didn't worth my kidney.😢😢😢😢my kidney....... you Apple....\n",

      "review I am coming from galaxy note 10 and all time android user, so I already have a taste of premium devices.This felt more premium, the body felt solid, but ergonomically this phone is a mess, its heavy, too wide to grip comfortably but it has this weird solid feel to it.Apart from this everything just works, bluetooth connectivity is godly, battery is like nothing else, camera is great, doesnt even sweat playing pubg at hdr extreme. Slowdowns what are those?If you want the best this is it.CONS:1) Note 10's display is way better, yes this display is more natural but that felt way good to eyes, ios should give a vivid profile. True tone is bs2) Why you so wide and heavy phonePros:1) it just works, everything just works and works the best unlike ray tracing on turing\n",
      "review Really good quality and amazon has really taken good responsibility to deliver the product in time\n",
      "review green colour is awsm\n",
      "review Heating issue to high\n",
      "review This is the iPhone having a battery which allows the phone to be used with all its glory for at least 12 hours if not 15 hours without recharging it. However the battery discharge is slightly more, after the recent updates. Camera is excellent. Overall. it is simply an IPhone, no other phone can match the experience.\n",
      "review My device is showing as non covered warranty, even I purchased it only 2 months ago\n",
      "review I broke my iphone 11 so bought the 11 pro max, so you could say that im upgrading from the iPhone 11.The display is bright and crisp as you would expect from apple, BUT its not as good as the display on the samaung galaxy s10 plus or even note 10 plus.If youre looking for the beat display in a phone you should buy the flagship phone of samsung, and yes I know apple uses samsung displays but still I found the s10’s display MUCH MUHC MUCH BETTER.The battery life is exceptionally long lasting which is usually not expected from apple. Even the fast charger charges the phone in about an hour and the battery easily lasts 12 hours of continuous use.The camera is good BUT the the wide angle lens really needs a lot of light to capture sharp images or else youll see a lottt of noise in the image and would look grainy. Night mode is really good I could day best in the segment.We really dont need to discuss about the processor and performance. Apple despite always having less ram is still much much faster in opening apps and overall ios is a lot more smoother than android and unlike androids, youll get frequent software updates for like 4 years.The display could have been a bit more punchy with more saturated colors like samsung, otherwise its a superb phone and if you afford it you should really go for it.\n",
      "review Only network issues.. network Signal always less.. so after purchase of huge money.. and poor signal quality., then it’s doesn’t deserve such expensive\n",
      "review For two-three years, Android phones were churning out better photos than the iPhone. With the iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple has reclaimed the top spot in smartphone photography and how!Pros:THE CAMERA-• Images are sharper than ever before without destroying the natural textures, white balance more accurate and night mode brightens the nigh time photos without taking the essence from the night scene away. Colours are accurate at the cost of looking desaturated at times. But the images will appeal to those with a trained eye. It’s not for those who are easily wowed by the over-sharpened, aggressively noise-reduced, extra bright, hyper-saturated and overexposed photos of Samsung flagships.• Deep fusion on the iOS 13.3 update has brought wonders to the image processing game and it will push other manufacturers to take note and improve. Layers of underexposed and one overexposed images are stacked by the processor and The software sharpens the things that need to be sharpened like threads on clothing, texture on bricks etc.• Lens flare still persists and often images in bright sunshine can suffer from lens flare issues.• Video recordings remains the benchmark on iPhones and this year the gap between other brands and the iPhone has widened further. This phone can record 4K on all four cameras! Front and rear. And that too in glorious 60fps.THE BATTERY-• Never has an iPhone lasted more than a day for me with average to heavy use.Just know that this is a battery beast and won’t let you down. Apple has increased the thickness and removed the 3D Touch layer giving exceptional battery life to this phone.FAST CHARGER INCLUDED-• This year the 11 pro and pro Max come with an 18w charger and USB-C to lightning cable in the box. Much needed relief and no more painful slow charging times of 3+ hours. The iPhone 11 (non-pro) still comes with a measly 5w charger.MATTE FINISH GLASS-• This changes the look of the phone, hides the fingerprints and scratches much better and the matte finish plays with the light very well giving a shiny reflectivity to the phone when held against flattering light.THE DISPLAY-• Now brighter in direct sunlight up to 1200 nits and is better calibrated for HDR content. Apple continues to excel at display calibration. No complaints of OLED burn-in and image retention.FASTEST PROCESSOR ON THE MARKET-• The A13 Bionic smashes the benchmarks and makes the competition look ancient by comparison.• Excellent gaming performance in graphics intensive games like Asphalt 9, Fortnite, Pubg, Modern Combat 5 etc. This phone offers 60fps gaming in an ever increasing catalogue of games for iOS.Cons:• Low base storage @ 64GB• iOS 13 is buggy• Super expensive in India.• Expensive to repair physical damage to screen or back glass - the back glass costs approx 40,000/- to replace!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!FINAL THOUGHTS-An excellent offering by Apple.• The best camera on the market.• The best battery ever in an iPhone by a huge margin.• Unrivalled performance.• The phone with the most longevity in terms of hardware quality and software support. Typically 5 years of iOS updates. Samsung are you listening?****Should you upgrade if you have an iPhone XS Max?****I’d say the battery improvements alone warrant an upgrade plus you get an excellent and much improved camera. Well, I’d say it depends on your finances and how much you manage to get for your old phone in trade-in value. If you get a good deal, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is worth it.\n",
      "review It’s my first iOS Device after my Macbook and I’m simply Amazed with it. I’ve use almost every flagship android like pixel and galaxy notes and no one comes close to this. Cameras and Battery is absolutely top notch, Design, weight, Notifications are could be little better but I’m pretty happy with my decision to going with this.\n",
      "review Product is awesome. First time I am using iPhone. Plus points are battery life and user interface. It never fails to do tasks you throw at and is always consistent in performance. This is where most of android devices lack. Screen quality is good and Retina display is really you will appreciate as compared to other premium android phones display. It just looks different in better way. The design is no doubt good although it’s heavy but easy to handle. Standby battery life is great. For Standby of 6-7 hours with WiFi connected Bluetooth on it only decreases marginally by 1-4%. Overall too much better than custom android user interfaces and android usability.\n",
      "review Very much impressive it’s my first experience in using apple very happy\n",
      "review The true machine !! Ultimately you can say the best iPhone ever made !! Full day battery !! Best in the class display !! Night mode should be better !! Best ever iPhone to upgrade !!11 Pro max rocks\n",
      "review I upgraded from a 6s plus to this phone. Apple has made a phone worth a lac and a half for the top version however Apple has to think a lot on the external appearance of the phone and its features. The cameras and battery are no doubt outstanding. But the diagonal width has been stretched to 6.5 inch and the width has remained constant making the phone very long and narrow and lowering the aesthetic look. Moreover the phone display is cut out at the top where the sensors and front camera is placed. Apple should have introduced more features and Apps considering such an expensive phone.\n",
      "review Wow, this phone is a beast. No wonder why it’s priced so high. It’s the father of all phones... To top that I must mention Amazon’s super fast express delivery. The phone was delivered to me in flat 4.5 hours after ordering. Now coming to this beast phone.Pros: 1. This has the best camera features as compared to any other phone. The best feature is the night vision camera.2. The batter life is much better than other apple phone’s.3. The price is high but that is expected of iphone. Either you can buy it or you cannot. That depends on individuals budget.Cons: 1. The only thing bad is the weight. But then I purchased 256 GB and that will be bulky.My personal experience says this phone is a must buy.\n",
      "review A little heavy but very nice\n",
      "review Camera is the best part\n",
      "review After  1 month use: Battery life is is excellent. Camera gives natural colours. It could have inscreen finger print. Audio quality is excellent for dual speakers for stereo effect. Screen mirroring difficult as your tv should have Apple airplay. Also you can not stream some content of Apple TV through AirPlay.  IOS is smooth to handle. But there is always some restrictions. Apps are pricy.\n",
      "review Have been an apple customer for 7 years now and this is my 7th apple product. My 3 day old iPhone 11 Promax has already developed a glitch. The screen lock button doesn’t work sometimes. It’s so irritating. Have been trying to call Apple support and the earliest appointment for the call us 6th sept. Really. Sometimes I feel Apple’s performance is over rated for the money it charges.\n"

      "review The only chinks in the armour surface from a lacklustre iOS 13 release, which although has some great features, is currently under a lot of stress and duress with some major bugs creeping into the software, the most important being the non-working of the ever so ubiquitous Reminders app. But that is only a passing phase as the rollout of major releases with bug fixes should fix most problems in the coming few days, in the coming few weeks and in the coming few months. But in any case, that simply does not take anything away from iPhone 11 Pro Max, its a wonderful smartphone that should suffice the needs of most new users as well as those of most brand loyalists alike. Apple has finally delivered an uber cool device after a few sombre years where the company's growth seemed to had hit a plateau. The iPhone 11 Pro Max, even though not being too innovative, is arguably the best premium smartphone in the market available by far for almost everything that a smartphone should be and the phone should give Apple a sizeable lead over its main competitors, Samsung and OnePlus, now that Huawei has hit a roadblock. But in all, you cannot go wrong with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, so you shouldn't think twice while buying this smartphone, it is indeed a very fruitful investment!!\n",

      "review It’s a good phone. The box was all dusty and so was the phone inside. Suppose it had been opened for checking or something prior. Plus it’s old, date of import on the box is October 2019 so almost 10 months old. The MRP on the box is 1,41,900 and sold on Amazon for about 5,000 higher after a credit card discount, that’s not fair. I would recommend buying straight from an Apple store anyday. I had to buy it on Amazon from Appario retail because we’re still staying home due to COVID.\n",
      "review Have had a very good experience with this phone so far. The screen size, and over all touch and feel is amazing. It feels really well made and top quality. You can feel the Apple quality.The battery life is amazing, earlier iPhones I would need to charge by 6 in the evening. This phone gives me 16 - 18 hours of use everyday with about 4 hours activity per day between phone calls, and different apps.The single best feature of this phone is the camera. No other phone comes close. The detail and resolution is spectacular. Especially the night mode.Have done a few (not scientific) trials of taking the same photo simultaneously with friends who have flagship smart phones of other brands, and even the most anti apple people also admit that the photos and amazing.You don’t buy an Apple flagship phone for value for money, yes there are many phones that are good and may be far cheaper, but... it’s not an iPhone\n",
      "review Shifted from a google  pixel 2xl love the rear camera on the iPhone but I miss the night sight on the front camera, have figured out ways to download torrent movies and watch them on vlc player. Besides that I love the continuity feature as I own a iPad too answering calls in the iPad when my phone isn’t with me is super convenient. I’m a spec lover but I believe in function over show off. So as a tech lover I can’t say you get what you pay for but I can surely say you get best the mobile industry has to offer. To top it all the battery life is just outstanding 2 days of heavy usage\n",
      "review iPhone 11 Pro Max is an outstanding product. Apple has designed every aspect incl packaging with quality and inspiration in mind for the user. The product is wow with an effortless way of wirelessly transferring data from existing iPhone. So in no time you are ready to get started. Every aspect of finding your way around the way and it's applications is intuitive which makes this phone an outstanding one. All technical specs are market leading - processor, camera, form factor, battery, super retina xdr oled touchscreen. It's a little heavier though it doesn't create a problem.\n",
      "review Screen is pealing off after six months.\n",
      "review Top class phone altogether. Loved each bit of this beast. I am amazed by the battery back up. I think the only phone that can give it a competition in terms of quality is Samsung Note 10.  Photo clarity is the best among all the iPhone models till date. Price is a bit miss in India. Extremely costly. But, after you get this in your hand, then you can stay relaxed.\n",

      "review Its just a gimmick!! Is what you get is not what you pay, no fast charging and still display with big notch while phones with just 30000 are charging 0-100 in 30 minutes and I will never buy Apple to make it rich, I only buy their shares lol which will make me rich. As technology advances I don't mind buying a 30000 phone every year than buying a 123000 phone for three year with old tech (people who wants to show themselves as rich people and use this phone as status symbol can just ignore this comment ,)\n",
      "review Excellent device, yes its expensive but quality is top notch and I chose midnight green colour because its new and it’s growing on me. Bought it from Unicorn at the release date. Screen is a treat to the eye, Cameras are awesome, both front and rear. Night mode is fabulous (photos attached). Battery backup is great. Performance is mind blowing, Its blazing fast, handles anything you throw at it. Perfect phone and after IOS update 13.2 its got even better. Specially camera with deep fusion, resulting images are now with better texture, details and reduced noise especially in low light conditions.\n"
